# Summary

Clustering is a fundamental step in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) analysis, as it identifies cell subgroups with similar transcriptional profiles, facilitating cell-type annotation and the discovery of novel cell types. However, common clustering algorithms require users to manually specify a resolution parameter, which significantly affects the number of clusters and the resulting granularity of the analysis. This process introduces a subjective component that can hinder reproducibility. RESOLUTE (Robust Evaluation of Single-cell Optimal Leiden resolUtion on Topological Embeddings) is a Python package designed to automate the selection of the optimal clustering resolution. By leveraging established graph-theory and statistical metrics, such as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the Calinski-Harabasz index, RESOLUTE provides an objective, reproducible, and scalable framework for bioinformaticians to determine the most relevant clustering resolution in their single-cell data. Notably, RESOLUTE is fully compatible with the scVerse ecosystem.

# Statement of need

`Gala` is an Astropy-affiliated Python package for galactic dynamics. Python
enables wrapping low-level languages (e.g., C) for speed without losing
flexibility or ease-of-use in the user-interface. The API for `Gala` was
designed to provide a class-based and user-friendly interface to fast (C or
Cython-optimized) implementations of common operations such as gravitational
potential and force evaluation, orbit integration, dynamical transformations,
and chaos indicators for nonlinear dynamics. `Gala` also relies heavily on and
interfaces well with the implementations of physical units and astronomical
coordinate systems in the `Astropy` package [@astropy] (`astropy.units` and
`astropy.coordinates`).

`Gala` was designed to be used by both astronomical researchers and by
students in courses on gravitational dynamics or astronomy. It has already been
used in a number of scientific publications [@Pearson:2017] and has also been
used in graduate courses on Galactic dynamics to, e.g., provide interactive
visualizations of textbook material [@Binney:2008]. The combination of speed,
design, and support for Astropy functionality in `Gala` will enable exciting
scientific explorations of forthcoming data releases from the *Gaia* mission
[@gaia] by students and experts alike.

# State of the field                                                                                                                  

Several tools exist for galactic dynamics computations:                                                     
`galpy` [@Bovy:2015] is a Python package with similar goals,
providing orbit integration and potential classes for galactic dynamics.                                                              
`NEMO` [@Teuben:1995] is a well-established, comprehensive stellar dynamics                                                           
toolbox written primarily in C, offering extensive functionality but with a                                                           
steeper learning curve and less integration with modern Python workflows.                                                             
Other tools like `GalPot` provide specific Milky Way potential models but lack                                                        
the broader dynamical analysis capabilities.                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                        
`Gala` was built rather than contributing to existing projects for several                                                            
reasons. First, `Gala` was designed from the ground up to integrate seamlessly                                                        
with the Astropy ecosystem, using `astropy.units` and `astropy.coordinates`                                                           
as core dependencies rather than optional features. This tight integration                                                            
enables natural workflows for astronomers already using Astropy. Second,                                                              
`Gala`'s object-oriented API with consistent interfaces across subpackages                                                            
(potentials, integrators, dynamics) provides a more modular and extensible                                                            
design than alternatives available at the time. Third, `Gala` fills a specific                                                        
niche between simple demonstration codes and full N-body simulation packages                                                          
like `Gadget` [@Springel:2005] – it focuses on the common tasks in galactic                                                             
dynamics research (orbit integration, potential evaluation, coordinate                                                                
transformations) while maintaining both performance through C implementations                                                         
and usability through its Python interface.  

# Software design

`Gala`'s design philosophy is based on three core principles: (1) to provide a
user-friendly, modular, object-oriented API, (2) to use community tools and
standards (e.g., Astropy for coordinates and units handling), and (3) to use
low-level code (C/C++/Cython) for performance while keeping the user interface
in Python. Within each of the main subpackages in `gala` (`gala.potential`,
`gala.dynamics`, `gala.integrate`, etc.), we try to maintain a consistent API
for classes and functions. For example, all potential classes share a common
base class and implement methods for computing the potential, forces, density,
and other derived quantities at given positions. This also works for
compositions of potentials (i.e., multi-component potential models), which
share the potential base class but also act as a dictionary-like container for
different potential components. As another example, all integrators implement a
common interface for numerically integrating orbits. The integrators and core
potential functions are all implemented in C without support for units, but the
Python layer handles unit conversions and prepares data to dispatch to the C
layer appropriately.Within the coordinates subpackage, we extend Astropy's
coordinate classes to add more specialized coordinate frames and
transformations that are relevant for Galactic dynamics and Milky Way research.

# Research impact statement

`Gala` has demonstrated significant research impact and grown both its user base
and contributor community since its initial release. The package has evolved
through contributions from over 18 developers beyond the original core developer
(@adrn), with community members adding new features, reporting bugs, and
suggesting new features.

While `Gala` started as a tool primarily to support the core developer's
research, it has expanded organically to support a range of applications across
domains in astrophysics related to Milky Way and galactic dynamics. The package
has been used in over 400 publications (according to Google Scholar) spanning
topics in galactic dynamics such as modeling stellar streams [@Pearson:2017],
Milky Way mass modeling, and interpreting kinematic and stellar population
trends in the Galaxy. `Gala` is integrated within the Astropy ecosystem as an
affiliated package and has built functionality that extends the widely-used
`astropy.units` and `astropy.coordinates` subpackages. `Gala`'s impact extends
beyond citations in research: Because of its focus on usability and user
interface design, `Gala` has also been incorporated into graduate-level galactic
dynamics curricula at multiple institutions.

`Gala` has been downloaded over 100,000 times from PyPI and conda-forge yearly
(or ~2,000 downloads per week) over the past few years, demonstrating a broad
and active user community. Users span career stages from graduate students to
faculty and other established researchers and represent institutions around the
world. This broad adoption and active participation validate `Gala`'s role as
core community infrastructure for galactic dynamics research.

# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.
